# Physical Computing Class

##Week 1
Assignment: "Create a crazy machine, this machine can be useful or be self servient. The most important is to think about how a user is going to operate your machine. Think of knobs, switches, levers, etc"
###My Machine: The Cuisinator
1. The user enters the settings on the right side of the machine: number of people, how long they have, serving size.
2. The user uses the keyboard and touch screen interface to find meals. There is also an app for the phone so they can plan before they get home from work or while out at the grocery store.
3. The user puts the raw unwrapped ingredients into the compartments separating out meat, veggies, grains, and spices. If an ingredient is missing the system will warn the user but will make the dish anyway.
4. The user lets the machine do itâ€™s thing. It prepares the ingredients in the top part of the machine (Any leftover ingredients will be bagged by the system and put in the bottom compartment.) The food is then combined and the machine puts it in a pan and cooks it in the cooking compartment.
5. The waste is stored in the side of the machine. There is a knob to lift the hatch for the garbage to flow out of the machine.
